## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Focuses on having each class responsible for a single purpose.
2. **Open Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.
5. **Dependency Injection Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Data Storage**: Microsoft Excel

## UML Class Diagrams
